# Professional Summary

Program Technical Lead and AI & Automation Product Manager leading multi-team programs across classified federal environments. I build secure, automated cloud platforms and high-performing teams by treating complexity as structure to be understood, not avoided. Currently managing 10+ DevOps teams while serving as technical lead for AI platform initiatives spanning AWS GovCloud, NIPR, SIPR, JWICS, and SC networks. I deliver under impossible timelines—compressing 6-month projects into 9 weeks—while establishing scalable frameworks for cost optimization, support operations, and team development. Beyond infrastructure, I bring professional-grade multimedia skills to craft clear, compelling technical communications for Pentagon-level stakeholders.
